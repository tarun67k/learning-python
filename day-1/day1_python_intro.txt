1. **What is Python?**
   - Python is a computer programming language. It’s easy to learn and is used for many things like making websites, analyzing data, and building apps.

2. **History of Python**
   - Python was created by a man named Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.
   - The first version came out in 1991, and newer versions keep coming out with improvements.

5. **Ways to Run Python**
   - **Interactive Mode**: You can open a terminal, type `python`, and write code directly. It shows you results immediately.
   - **Script Mode**: You write Python code in a `.py` file and then run it using `python file_name.py`.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**: A special tool that lets you write and run small parts of code one by one, which is great for learning and data work.

6. **What is an IDE?**
   - **IDE** stands for Integrated Development Environment. It’s a program that helps you write, fix, and run code easily.
   - Some popular Python IDEs are:
     - **PyCharm**: Good for big projects.
     - **VS Code**: A light and easy editor with Python support.
     - **IDLE**: Python’s built-in editor, great for beginners.
     - **Jupyter**: Used a lot in data science because it’s interactive.
