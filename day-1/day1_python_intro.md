1. **What is Python?**
   - Python is a computer programming language. It’s easy to learn and is used for many things like making websites, analyzing data, and building apps.

2. **History of Python**
   - Python was created by a man named Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.
   - The first version came out in 1991, and newer versions keep coming out with improvements.

3. **Installing Python**
   - To get Python on your computer:
     1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python.
     2. Install it by following the steps for your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
     3. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation, so you can run it from the terminal.

4. **How Does Python Work?**
   - Python reads your code and runs it line by line. You write your code in a file, and Python makes it work on your computer.

5. **Ways to Run Python**
   - **Interactive Mode**: You can open a terminal, type `python`, and write code directly. It shows you results immediately.
   - **Script Mode**: You write Python code in a `.py` file and then run it using `python file_name.py`.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**: A special tool that lets you write and run small parts of code one by one, which is great for learning and data work.

6. **What is an IDE?**
   - **IDE** stands for Integrated Development Environment. It’s a program that helps you write, fix, and run code easily.
   - Some popular Python IDEs are:
     - **PyCharm**: Good for big projects.
     - **VS Code**: A light and easy editor with Python support.
     - **IDLE**: Python’s built-in editor, great for beginners.
     - **Jupyter**: Used a lot in data science because it’s interactive.

7. **Which IDE is good for you?**
   - **VS Code** is a good choice for most people. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and has lots of extensions for Python. It’s great for beginners and pros.
   - If you're doing bigger projects or want more features, **PyCharm** is excellent.

8. **How is Python execution done?**
   - Python code is run by the **Python interpreter**, which reads your code line by line and executes it. You can write code in a `.py` file and run it using the terminal (`python file_name.py`), or directly in an IDE.

9. **What type of language is Python?**
   - Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **object-oriented** language. It’s easy to read and write, and it doesn’t need to be compiled (like C or Java).

10. **Applications of Python**:
   - **Web development** (Django, Flask)
   - **Data science** and **machine learning** (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
   - **Automation** (scripting tasks)
   - **App development**
   - **Game development** (Pygame)
   - **Networking** and **cloud computing**.
